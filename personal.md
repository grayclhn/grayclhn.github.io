I need to fill this page in some more, but this is a start.  I'm an
Assistant Professor at Iowa State where I teach Economics and
Econometrics (that information is probably on the site's front page).
Before moving to Iowa, I lived in California for eight years; six in
grad school at UC San Diego and two before that in the San Francisco
bay area.  I went to Tufts University (it's outside Boston) for
undergrad where I majored in Mathematics and went to high school
outside of Philadelphia.

In addition to the links elsewhere on the site, I have a few others:

* I've set up a blog for updates on my family and kids; email me if
  you want the URL and please remind me why you should have it.

* The site feed, [gray.clhn.co/rss.xml](/rss.xml), is for
  announcements: presentations, papers, etc. I used to use it as a
  linkblog too, but I'm using Tumblr now instead:
  [www.pseudotrue.com](http://www.pseudotrue.com).

* I'm not on Facebook any more and I delete and reinstate my Twitter
  account so often that I'm surprised it's not marked as spam, but if
  it's up, it's [@gfcal](https://www.twitter.com/gfcal). If you need
  to contact me, please call or email me. My personal email address,
  <gray@clhn.co>, also works for IM (Jabber).

Information about my [teaching](/index.html#Teaching),
[research](/index.html#Research), and [software
projects](/index.html#Software) is available on the [front
page](/index.html), as is my [contact
information](/index.html#Information).

I need to fill this page in some more, but this is a start.  I'm an
Assistant Professor at Iowa State where I teach Economics and
Econometrics (that information is probably on the site's front page).
Before moving to Iowa, I lived in California for 8 years; 6 in grad
school at UC San Diego and two before that in the San Francisco bay
area.  I went to Tufts University (outside of Boston) for undergrad
where I majored in Mathematics and went to high school outside of
Philadelphia.

In addition to the links elsewhere on the site, I have a few others:

* I have a sports blog that I post a few sports-related statistical graphics:
  <http://untitledsports.tumblr.com>. 

* I've set up a blog for updates on my family and kids; email me if
  you want the URL and please remind me why you should have it.

* I'm not on Facebook or Twitter any more; if you need to contact me,
  please call or email me.

* The site feed, [http://gray.clhn.co/clips](/clips) or
  [http://gray.clhn.co/rss.xml](/rss.xml), serves as a
  microblog/linkblog.  I announce presentations, papers, etc. through
  it, but I also post links or articles I find interesting.

Information about my [teaching](/index.html#Teaching),
[research](/index.html#Research), and [software
projects](/index.html#Software) is available on the [front
page](/index.html), as is my [contact
information](/index.html#Information).

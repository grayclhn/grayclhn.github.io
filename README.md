Personal/professional web page: <http://gray.clhn.co>

I'm in the process of setting this website up, so the README file is a
little terse.  I'll try to fill it in as I go.  The only important
information is this: I consider *only the master branch to be public.*
I will rebase the other branches on a whim.  And, honestly, I may
rebase master from time to time as well.  How likely is anyone to
clone and maintain a copy of my website?

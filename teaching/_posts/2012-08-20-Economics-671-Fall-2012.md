This is the course webpage for Economics 671 at Iowa State (Fall
2012). It has a few links, and that's about it. I'll add material as
we move through the semester.

* [Course syllabus](/handouts/2012/econ-671-syllabus.html)

* Exams from previous years:

  * 2011 [midterm](/downloads/econ-671-2011-midterm.pdf) and 
  [final](/downloads/econ-671-2011-final.pdf)

  * 2010 [midterm](/downloads/econ-671-2010-midterm.pdf) and 
  [final](/downloads/econ-671-2010-final.pdf)

  * 2009 [final](/downloads/econ-671-2009-final.pdf) (I've misplaced
  the midterm)

I'm changing the order of the material substantially from previous
years, so don't use past exams as study guides. But the old exams
might help you learn what sort of questions I find interesting.

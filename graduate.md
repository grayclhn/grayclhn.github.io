I teach PhD Econometrics 1 (Economics 671) in the Fall.  Materials
from previous years are available at
<http://www.econ.iastate.edu/~gcalhoun> until I move them to this webpage.

[Helle Bunzel](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/bunzel/homep.html)
and I will teach PhD Macroeconometrics (Economics 674) in Spring,
2013.  I'll post information and material for that class as I develop
it.

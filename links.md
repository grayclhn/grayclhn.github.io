title: Other interesting websites

I'm still in the process of adding bookmarks here and there may be
some overlap between the categories. This is not meant to be a
comprehensive list of everything on the web, everything I think is
important, or even everything that Economics students might or should
find interesting. It's just a list of some websites. Let me know if
there's anything else you think I'd like.

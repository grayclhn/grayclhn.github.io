title: About this website
---

I use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) (obviously)
and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (maybe less obviously) to produce
this website.  It is hosted at
[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/), and the
sourcecode is hosted by [GitHub](https://www.github.com) at
<https://github.com/gcalhoun/gray.clhn.co>.

Twitter Bootstrap is licensed under the [Apache License
v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and Jekyll under the
[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so both are freely
available for your own work.

Site updates are available at [gray.clhn.co/clips](/clips) or as an
XML feed at [gray.clhn.co/rss.xml](/rss.xml).  

Please report any problems by emailing <gray@clhn.co> or opening a
[new issue at
GitHub](https://github.com/gcalhoun/gray.clhn.co/issues/new).

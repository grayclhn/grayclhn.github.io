title: About this website
---

I use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
(obviously) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (maybe less obviously)
to produce this website.  It is hosted at
[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/).

Twitter Bootstrap is licensed under the [Apache License
v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and Jekyll under the
[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so both are freely
available for your own work.

Site updates are available at [gray.clhn.co/clips](/clips) or as an
XML feed at [gray.clhn.co/rss.xml](/rss.xml).  

Please report any problems to <gray@clhn.co>.

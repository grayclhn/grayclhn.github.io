I'll add quotations in the future as I find them.

* "Don’t worry about people stealing an idea. If it’s original, you will 
  have to ram it down their throats." Howard Aiken (1900 to 1973)
  <http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken>

* "To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more
  than asking him to perform a postmortem examination: he may be able to 
  say what the experiment died of." Ronald Fisher (1890 to 1962)  
  <http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher>

* "The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not 
  ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data."
  John Tukey (1915 to 2000)
  <http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Tukey>

* "Rules of Optimization:
  * Rule 1: Don't do it.
  * Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet."  
  M.A. Jackson

* "More computing sins are committed in the name of effeciencey (without
  necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason, including
  blind stupidity." W.A. Wulf

Practice questions from the textbooks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be especially good preparation for the final exam to work on answers
to the following questions. (All of them are from the end of chapter exercises.)

* Ramanathan: 5.4, 6.9, 7.3, 8.8, 9.9
* Hayashi chapter 1: 1, 2, 4, and 5; chapter 2: 2, 3, and 7.

If you have time, the other questions are also good. But you should prioritize
these questions.

Fall, 2015 Grade Weights
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Grade weights for 2015 were negotiated to be:

* Individual scores: 20% (further split into 70% for the iRATs and 30%
  for the final exam)
* Team scores: 60% (30% tRAT and 70% graded class activities)
* Peer evaluations: 20%

Material from previous years
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve changed the order and presentation of the material substantially
from year to year, so don’t use past exams as study guides. But the
old exams might help you learn what sort of questions I find
interesting.

* 2014 [syllabus](syllabus-2014.pdf) and [reading guide](readingguide-2014.pdf)
* 2013 [syllabus](syllabus-2013) and [final exam](test-final-2013.pdf)
* 2012 [syllabus](syllabus-2012),
  [midterm 1](test1-2012.pdf) and
  [midterm 2](test2-2012.pdf)
* 2011 [syllabus](syllabus-2011.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2011.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2011.pdf)
* 2010 [syllabus](syllabus-2010.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2010.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2010.pdf)
* 2009 [syllabus](syllabus-2009.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2009.pdf), and

Feel free to use any of this material if you are teaching a similar
class. I will try to help out with lecture notes, etc., if you email
me: <gcalhoun@iastate.edu>.

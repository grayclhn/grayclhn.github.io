Practice questions from the textbooks
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It would be especially good preparation for the final exam to work on answers
to the following questions. (All of them are from the end of chapter exercises.)

* Ramanathan: 5.4, 6.9, 7.3, 8.8, 9.9
* Hayashi chapter 1: 1, 2, 4, and 5; chapter 2: 2, 3, and 7.

If you have time, the other questions are also good. But you should prioritize
these questions.

Material from previous years
----------------------------

I’ve changed the order and presentation of the material substantially
from year to year, so don’t use past exams as study guides. But the
old exams might help you learn what sort of questions I find
interesting.

* 2013 [syllabus](syllabus-2013) and [final exam](test-final-2013.pdf)

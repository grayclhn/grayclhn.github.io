title: LaTeX CV template

I recently read Karen Kelsky's ("Dr. Karen's") excellent [academic CV
advice][1] and tried to follow her advice and revise [my CV][2]. It
seems like something other people could find useful, so I wrote up
most of the changes as a LaTeX document class (the `safecv` document
class) and put it [here on GitHub][3].

There's a document class that loads all of the necessary packages and
sets up formatting for section headers, etc. And there are also two
empty-ish templates to use for your own CV. One's tailored a bit
towards grad students entering the academic job market for the first
time, and one's more generic. I'm not a graphic designer, and you're
probably not either, so the CV's in Times New Roman, the default,
conservative, "professional" font for those of us who predate Office
2007, which is essentially everyone who will be in a position to hire
you right now. (Since I have no impulse control, I took this
opportunity to [buy the Lucida TeX fonts][4] and could not be happier
with them CV. But my wife still insists that my CV looks better in
Times.)

Is it a great CV template? Nope. Is it better than most of the other
CV templates I've seen? Yep. Almost entirely because, as Dr. Karen
suggests, all of the important dates are flush left and the text is
relentlessly left-aligned. Most of the other templates are much
slicker looking, but they put key information in different random
spots in different sections of the CV. Don't do that.

Please open an issue if you find errors. Pull requests are welcome
too. And read [Dr. Karen's advice][1] most of all.

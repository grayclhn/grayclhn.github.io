* [Econ 671 Computing Handout](/2011/08/01/computing-handout.html): I
  originally wrote this handout for my graduate econometrics class. It
  may be interesting to other people too, so I've moved it to this
  part of the webpage (Last edited in August, 2011).

* [An extremely subjective outline of the economics job market](/2009/09/01/job-market-notes.html):
  I put together an outline of my thoughts about the economics job
  market, mostly to help the 2010 UCSD graduating class. It reflects
  only my own experience and opinion (except for a few comments by
  others), so it is likely to be misleading and incomplete. But, now
  that I've typed it up, I see no reason not to put it online. Please
  let me know if you have additional comments that you think should be
  added.

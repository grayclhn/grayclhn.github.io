It's probably a bad idea, but I've decided to use GitHub's issue tracker to
allow comments on my website. You can [open a new issue to add a comment][1] or
suggestion or [add comments to an existing issue for a quasi forum][2]. This
approach is somewhat inspired by [this blog post][3] but is obviously a much
worse idea. You may need a GitHub account to comment; if you don't want one, you
can also email <gray@clhn.org> directly.
